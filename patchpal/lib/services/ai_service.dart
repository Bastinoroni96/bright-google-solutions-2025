- Your hydration levels need immediate attention

I recommend:
1. Rest and stay hydrated with regular water intake
2. Avoid strenuous activities until your vitals normalize
3. Monitor for additional symptoms like headaches or muscle aches
4. Consider taking over-the-counter fever reducers if appropriate
5. If symptoms persist for more than 24 hours or worsen, consult with a healthcare provider

Continue monitoring your vital signs and schedule a follow-up scan in 4-6 hours.''';

- Heart rate: ${vitalSign.heartRate} bpm (mildly elevated)
- Hydration: Your hydration status shows early signs of dehydration

My recommendations:
- Drink water regularly throughout the day
- Get adequate rest tonight
- Avoid intense physical activity for the next 12-24 hours
- Monitor for developing symptoms like headache, chills, or general discomfort

If your temperature rises above 38째C or your symptoms worsen, consider contacting your healthcare provider. Otherwise, your next check-in is recommended in 24 hours.''';

Keep doing what you're doing! Maintain a balanced diet, stay hydrated, get regular exercise, and ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night). These healthy habits are clearly working for you.

Your next health check-in is recommended in 24 hours or as needed. If you experience any changes in how you feel, you can always check back sooner.''';
